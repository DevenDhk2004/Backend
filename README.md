# Backend

*Backend refers to the server-side of a website or application that handles data processing, business logic, and database interactions. It includes servers, databases, APIs, and application logic that work behind the scenes to support frontend functionality. Backend development involves programming languages like Python, Java, Node.js, or PHP, along with frameworks like Django, Spring Boot, or Express.js. It ensures secure data storage, user authentication, and smooth communication between the frontend and database, enabling the application to function properly.*
